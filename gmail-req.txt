Good evening! I'll create a Tampermonkey script that monitors your Gmail inbox and automatically replies "Very Interesting Article" when someone sends you a PDF file or a URL.I've created a Tampermonkey script that will automatically reply "Very Interesting Article" to emails containing PDFs or URLs. Here's what it does:

**Features:**
- Monitors your Gmail inbox for new emails
- Detects PDF attachments by looking for ".pdf" in attachment elements
- Detects URLs in email bodies using pattern matching
- Automatically clicks reply and sends the message
- Tracks processed emails to avoid duplicate replies

**To install:**
1. Make sure you have Tampermonkey installed in your browser
2. Click the Tampermonkey icon and select "Create a new script"
3. Replace the default content with this script
4. Save it (Ctrl+S or Cmd+S)
5. The script will automatically run when you visit Gmail

**Important notes:**
- The script checks for new emails every 3 seconds
- It only processes each email once (tracked by message ID)
- Gmail's interface can change, so you may need to adjust selectors if Gmail updates
- Test this carefully - automatic replies can't be undone!

You might want to test it with a friend first to make sure it works as expected before relying on it for important emails.
